## üö© [Objective]
- Analysis software for orthodontics was implemented as a prototype of a web application program.
- To compare the performance and characteristics of canvas vs svg vs webp.
- It is a software for dental, so orthodontic clinical knowledge is required.
- It is one of the projects that migration the V-Ceph desktop Win32/MFC application to the web.<br/>

## üõ†Ô∏è [Technologies]
- **"React18.js"**: used for implementation as a framework for single-page applications(SPA).
- **"HTML5 canvas graphics"**: Allows dynamic rendering of two-dimensional shapes and scriptable bitmap plots as part of HTML5.
<br/><br/>

## ‚öôÔ∏è [Instructions]
 - Because an openssl security vulnerability may cause errors during execution, we added the following command line options.
```bash
    "start": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start",
    "build": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider build",
```

**[run]**
```bash
  npm install
  npm run start
```

**[build]**
```bash
  npm run build
```
<br/>

## üìå [Features]
* The implementation is not yet complete. (Since it is prototyped, various experiments are needed.)
* The plan for the product has not been finalized.
* Log-in, image management, and calibration analysis results for user authentication were not applied.
